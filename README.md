## Enhancements from Original

![ui bug](http://paulfreeman.design/ui-bug-in-original.png)

**UI bug** - the original has a minor UI bug where the top of the feedback icon is cut off at the start of the animation. The version here does not.

**Slight change in animation timing** - the original fades the feedback icon and 'Take Again' button in at the same time. I chose to fade the 'Take Again' button in with a slight delay to give the user better awareness of the option.

## Technical Requirements
